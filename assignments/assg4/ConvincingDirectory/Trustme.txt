I pledge on my honour and the Gita, that I have not used(except assignment 1) and will not use any unfair means( give or receive unauthorised assistance of any kind ) during this examination, or any other future examination or assignment in this course. I shared my code with a friend in assignment 1, which I THOROUGHLY regret, and which I sincerely beg your forgiveness for.


I gave a lot of time to solve this assignment and as you can see from my essay pdf and the comprehensive explanations that I gave there, I learnt a lot of concepts and things which I wouldn't have known unless I implemented all of the programs myself.
